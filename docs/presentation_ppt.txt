Team: [Your Names]  •  Course: [Course Name]  •  Date: 15/01/26

Slide 2: Problem & Objective
- Problem: Farmers need faster, reliable pest/disease advice, accurate yield estimates, and market access.
- Objective: Provide a trusted platform for reporting issues, AI-assisted diagnosis, yield prediction, expert help, and marketplace services.

Slide 3: Existing System vs Proposed System
- Existing (manual): Local visits, ad-hoc advice (calls/WhatsApp), inconsistent record-keeping, informal marketplace.
- Proposed (this project): Structured issue reporting, AI-assisted initial diagnosis, stored predictions, expert chat, marketplace, and officer-managed inventory.

Slide 4: Key Features (high level)
- AI disease diagnosis (image + symptoms) for quick triage
- Yield prediction using farm data + weather
- Expert–farmer chat with ratings and treatment reports
- Marketplace for farmer products with listings and stock
- Officer portal for notices and product distribution

Slide 5: Role-based Features & User Stories
- Farmer:
    - Report crop issues with images and symptoms.
    - Request yield predictions and view history.
    - List products for sale and manage listings.
- Expert:
    - View assigned issues, provide diagnosis and treatment plans.
    - Communicate via chat and receive ratings.
- Krishi Bhavan Officer:
    - Post official notices, manage product inventory and approve requests.
    - Audit stock changes and distribution history.
- Admin:
    - Manage users, ML datasets, model training records, and system settings.

Slide 6: System Architecture (concise)
- Frontend: Server-rendered templates (Jinja2) plus static JS/CSS for interactivity.
- Backend: Flask app (routes in `app/routes/`), business logic and authentication.
- Storage: SQL database via SQLAlchemy (SQLite locally, PostgreSQL in production) + file storage for uploads.
- ML: Models stored in `ml/` and loaded with `joblib` for inference.

Slide 7: Technology Stack (concise)
- Backend: Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login
- Database: SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)
- ML & Data: scikit-learn, numpy, joblib, pandas
- Utilities: Pillow (images), requests, bcrypt (passwords)
- Deployment: gunicorn, psycopg2-binary (Postgres driver)

Slide 8: ML Algorithms — What & Why (simple)
- Disease diagnosis (images): Transfer learning with a lightweight CNN (e.g., MobileNet/ResNet via transfer learning).
    - Why: Learns visual features; transfer learning works well with modest datasets and reduces training time.
- Yield prediction (tabular): Ensemble regressors (Random Forest / Gradient Boosting) or linear regression depending on dataset.
    - Why: Ensembles handle mixed features and reduce overfitting; they also give feature importance for explanations.
- Deployment note: Tabular models use `scikit-learn`; image models can be exported as lightweight artifacts for inference.

Slide 9: Database Overview (concise)
- Main entities: `users`, `crop_issues`, `yield_predictions`, `diagnosis_reports`, `chat_messages`, `farmer_products`, `products`, and ML tables (`ml_datasets`, `model_trainings`, `model_performance`).

Notes: This file is the sorted, concise text PPT. Each "Slide N" maps to a single slide.

Slide 27: Role-based Features & User Stories
- Farmer (user stories):
    - As a farmer, I can report crop issues with images so experts can diagnose remotely.
    - As a farmer, I can request yield estimates using my farm details and weather data.
    - As a farmer, I can list products on the marketplace to sell excess produce.
- Expert (user stories):
    - As an expert, I can view assigned crop issues, provide diagnosis and treatment plans.
    - As an expert, I can rate and comment on farmer issues to improve service quality.
- Krishi Bhavan Officer (user stories):
    - As an officer, I can post notices, manage government product inventory and approve requests.
    - As an officer, I can see product stock history and audit changes.
- Admin (user stories):
    - As an admin, I can manage users (farmers, experts, officers), ML datasets, and system settings.
    - As an admin, I can view model training jobs and performance metrics.

Slide 28: Existing System vs Proposed System
- Existing (typical manual context):
    - Farmers rely on local visits, phone calls, or scattered WhatsApp images for advice.
    - Yield estimates are ad-hoc and often inaccurate; record-keeping is minimal.
    - Marketplace interactions are informal and hard to scale.
- Proposed (our Farmers Portal):
    - Structured issue reporting with images and symptoms, AI-assisted initial diagnosis.
    - Automated yield predictions using farm + weather data, stored results for comparison.
    - Integrated marketplace, chat between farmers and experts, and officer-managed distributions.
    - Centralized admin controls for datasets, model training and monitoring.

Slide 29: Learning Algorithms — Types & Why
- Disease diagnosis (images):
    - Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) / Transfer Learning (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet).
    - Why: CNNs learn visual patterns (leaf spots, discoloration) automatically; transfer learning gives good accuracy with limited data and is fast to fine-tune.
- Yield prediction (tabular):
    - Type: Ensemble regressors (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) or linear models depending on data.
    - Why: Ensemble methods handle mixed feature types, reduce overfitting, and provide robust predictions with interpretable feature importance.
- Practical note: For quick prototyping we use `scikit-learn` for tabular models; for image models we recommend lightweight transfer learning and `joblib`/serialized model artifacts for deployment.

Slide 30: Future Scope
- Add model monitoring (drift detection) and automatic retraining pipelines.
- Use more labeled image data + augmentation to improve disease model accuracy.
- Add push notifications for urgent officer alerts and in-app scheduling for product distributions.
- Expand marketplace features: orders, secure payments, ratings for buyers/sellers.

Slide 31: Conclusion & Trustworthiness
- Conclusion: Farmers Portal centralizes reporting, speeds up diagnostics, and connects farmers to experts and officers.
- Trustworthiness: role-based access control, officer verification for public notices, and audit logs for inventory changes increase reliability.
- Call to action: Focus next on data quality (labeling), model monitoring, and production deployment with PostgreSQL.
