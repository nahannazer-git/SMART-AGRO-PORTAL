                        PROJECT DEVELOPMENT LOG & HANDOVER
================================================================================
DATE: 2025-12-10
PROJECT: SMART AGRICULTURE SUPPORT SYSTEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. SESSION OBJECTIVES
   - Fix "Chat with Expert" functionality (Fetch errors, duplicates, images).
   - Resolve Logout redirection issues.
   - Restructure "Marketplace First" to "Portal First" architecture.
   - Fix Admin Dashboard statistics errors.
   - Push complete codebase to GitHub.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. CRITICAL ERRORS ENCOUNTERED & FIXED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[E1] Chat "Failed to fetch" Error
   - SYMPTOM: Chat messages wouldn't load or send; console showed fetch errors.
   - CAUSE: Using Jinja2 `{{ url_for(...) }}` inside external .js files or un-rendered script blocks blocks resulted in invalid URLs.
   - FIX: Replaced dynamic Jinja paths with hardcoded absolute routes (e.g., `/farmer/chat/...`).

[E2] Duplicate "Ghost" Messages
   - SYMPTOM: Sending a message caused it to appear twice (once immediately, once from polling).
   - CAUSE: The polling mechanism retrieved ALL messages, including the one just sent by the user.
   - FIX: Implemented filtering in the polling logic to ignore messages where `sender_id` matches the current user.

[E3] Image Preview Not Showing / NameError in Chat
   - SYMPTOM: "Preview" container missing; Backend crashed with `NameError: message not defined`.
   - CAUSE: 
     1. The HTML for `#imagePreviewContainer` was accidentally overwritten.
     2. In `farmer.py`, the line `message = request.form.get('message')` was deleted during refactoring.
   - FIX: Restored HTML container and the missing Python variable assignment.

[E4] Logout Redirection Loop
   - SYMPTOM: Logging out kept redirecting back to the Dashboard instead of the Login/Home page.
   - CAUSE: Browser caching and persistent Session cookies were too aggressive.
   - FIX: In `auth.py/logout`:
     1. Manually cleared all session keys.
     2. Deleted `remember_token` cookie.
     3. Added `Cache-Control: no-cache` headers to the redirect response.

[E5] Admin Statistics Error (TypeError: Function.__init__ got 'else')
   - SYMPTOM: Admin > Statistics > Diseases page crashed (500 Error).
   - CAUSE: Improper usage of `func.case(...)` in SQLAlchemy. `func` is for SQL functions, `case` is an expression.
   - FIX: Imported `case` from `sqlalchemy` and used `case(...)` directly instead of `func.case(...)`.

[E6] Git Push Errors (Unrelated Histories)
   - SYMPTOM: "Fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories".
   - CAUSE: The remote repo (GitHub) was created with a README, while local repo was initialized separately.
   - FIX: Ran `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories` to merge them before pushing.

[E7] PDF Report Text Overlapping
   - SYMPTOM: in downloaded PDF reports, long text from database columns overlapped with adjacent cells, making it unreadable.
   - CAUSE: The PDF generation logic used fixed-width strings without wrapping capabilities.
   - FIX: Refactored `app/utils/reports.py` to wrap all table cells in ReportLab `Paragraph` objects, enabling automatic text wrapping and dynamic row heights.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[A] CHAT SYSTEM (Farmer & Expert)
   - Converted to partial AJAX (no page reloads).
   - Added Image Upload capability (`input type="file"`).
   - Added Image Thumbnail Preview with "Remove" button.
   - Implemented "Optimistic UI" (message appears instantly before server confirmation).

[B] PORTAL ARCHITECTURE
   - Created new Landing Page (`/`):
     - Displays 4 distinct Login Cards (Farmer, Expert, Officer, Admin).
     - "Admin" card added with distinct Red theme.
     - "Public Marketplace" clearly separated from login areas.
   - Updated Navigation:
     - Marketplace now has a "Back to Portal" button.
     - Removed "Login to Request" button from Marketplace (View Only mode).

[C] UI/UX ENHANCEMENTS
   - Added "Show Password" (Eye Icon) toggle to Farmer Login.
   - Standardized 4-column layout for Landing Page cards.

4. HOW TO RUN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Ensure Virtual Environment is active (`venv\Scripts\activate`).
2. Run `python run.py`.
3. Admin Login: Access via Landing Page -> Admin Card.
4. Public View: Access via Landing Page -> Browse Catalog.
