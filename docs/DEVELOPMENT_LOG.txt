                        PROJECT DEVELOPMENT LOG & HANDOVER
================================================================================
DATE: 2025-12-10 (Updated: Expert Rating Feature & Marketplace Fixes)
PROJECT: SMART AGRICULTURE SUPPORT SYSTEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. SESSION OBJECTIVES
   - Fix "Chat with Expert" functionality (Fetch errors, duplicates, images).
   - Resolve Logout redirection issues.
   - Restructure "Marketplace First" to "Portal First" architecture.
   - Fix Admin Dashboard statistics errors.
   - Push complete codebase to GitHub.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. CRITICAL ERRORS ENCOUNTERED & FIXED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[E1] Chat "Failed to fetch" Error
   - SYMPTOM: Chat messages wouldn't load or send; console showed fetch errors.
   - CAUSE: Using Jinja2 `{{ url_for(...) }}` inside external .js files or un-rendered script blocks blocks resulted in invalid URLs.
   - FIX: Replaced dynamic Jinja paths with hardcoded absolute routes (e.g., `/farmer/chat/...`).

[E2] Duplicate "Ghost" Messages
   - SYMPTOM: Sending a message caused it to appear twice (once immediately, once from polling).
   - CAUSE: The polling mechanism retrieved ALL messages, including the one just sent by the user.
   - FIX: Implemented filtering in the polling logic to ignore messages where `sender_id` matches the current user.

[E3] Image Preview Not Showing / NameError in Chat
   - SYMPTOM: "Preview" container missing; Backend crashed with `NameError: message not defined`.
   - CAUSE: 
     1. The HTML for `#imagePreviewContainer` was accidentally overwritten.
     2. In `farmer.py`, the line `message = request.form.get('message')` was deleted during refactoring.
   - FIX: Restored HTML container and the missing Python variable assignment.

[E4] Logout Redirection Loop
   - SYMPTOM: Logging out kept redirecting back to the Dashboard instead of the Login/Home page.
   - CAUSE: Browser caching and persistent Session cookies were too aggressive.
   - FIX: In `auth.py/logout`:
     1. Manually cleared all session keys.
     2. Deleted `remember_token` cookie.
     3. Added `Cache-Control: no-cache` headers to the redirect response.

[E5] Admin Statistics Error (TypeError: Function.__init__ got 'else')
   - SYMPTOM: Admin > Statistics > Diseases page crashed (500 Error).
   - CAUSE: Improper usage of `func.case(...)` in SQLAlchemy. `func` is for SQL functions, `case` is an expression.
   - FIX: Imported `case` from `sqlalchemy` and used `case(...)` directly instead of `func.case(...)`.

[E6] Git Push Errors (Unrelated Histories)
   - SYMPTOM: "Fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories".
   - CAUSE: The remote repo (GitHub) was created with a README, while local repo was initialized separately.
   - FIX: Ran `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories` to merge them before pushing.

[E7] PDF Report Text Overlapping
   - SYMPTOM: in downloaded PDF reports, long text from database columns overlapped with adjacent cells, making it unreadable.
   - CAUSE: The PDF generation logic used fixed-width strings without wrapping capabilities.
   - FIX: Refactored `app/utils/reports.py` to wrap all table cells in ReportLab `Paragraph` objects, enabling automatic text wrapping and dynamic row heights.

[E8] Expert Chat Send Button Not Working & Missing Image Upload Icon
   - SYMPTOM: 
     1. Expert-side chat send button failed to work.
     2. File input displayed as text field instead of icon (not user-friendly).
     3. No image preview functionality in expert chat.
   - ROOT CAUSE:
     1. Form submission handler tried to access non-existent `<select name="related_issue_id">` element.
     2. JavaScript error: `document.querySelector('select[name="related_issue_id"]').value` returned null, breaking form submission.
     3. File input was plain HTML with `.form-control` class (text appearance).
     4. No JavaScript event handlers for image file selection and preview.
   - SOLUTION APPLIED:
     1. **Removed non-existent form field reference** - Deleted the line trying to access missing select element.
     2. **Replaced file input with pin icon button**:
        - Hidden file input: `<input type="file" id="imageInput" class="d-none">`
        - Pin icon button: `<button id="imageUploadBtn"><i class="bi bi-pin"></i></button>`
        - Click handler: Button click triggers file input via `imageInput.click()`
     3. **Added image preview functionality**:
        - Preview container with thumbnail and close (X) button
        - FileReader API to show selected image before sending
        - Clear function to reset preview and input
     4. **Fixed form submission logic**:
        - Now sends only `message` and `image` fields (no related_issue_id)
        - Allows sending message-only or image-only
        - Proper FormData construction with file handling
        - Console logging for debugging
     5. **Enhanced both expert and farmer chat templates** with identical improvements:
        - Message deduplication by data-msg-id attribute
        - Image error fallback (SVG placeholder for missing images)
        - Poll URL logging for troubleshooting
        - Optimistic UI with server ID sync
   - VERIFICATION:
     - E2E test: 24+ messages persisting correctly
     - Expert poll endpoint returning all farmer messages with images
     - Send button now functional with working image uploads
     - Both farmer and expert sides have identical, seamless chat functionality

[E9] Expert Rating Feature Not Showing on Farmer Side
   - SYMPTOM: Farmers were unable to rate experts after receiving diagnosis reports.
   - CAUSE: 
     1. No route existed in `farmer.py` to handle rating submissions.
     2. The `view_disease_prediction` template didn't fetch or display diagnosis reports from experts.
     3. No UI component for rating submission was present in the farmer interface.
   - FIX:
     1. **Added rating route** (`/farmer/rate-expert`): Handles POST requests for rating submissions/updates.
     2. **Updated `view_disease_prediction` route**: Now fetches and passes `DiagnosisReport` and existing `ExpertRating` to template.
     3. **Enhanced template** (`farmer/view_disease_prediction.html`):
        - Displays complete expert diagnosis report (diagnosis, treatment plan, preventive measures, recommended products).
        - Added interactive star rating form (1-5 stars) with hover effects.
        - Shows existing rating if already submitted.
        - Allows updating existing ratings.
        - Optional comment field for detailed feedback.
     4. **Added imports**: `ExpertRating` and `DiagnosisReport` models to `farmer.py`.
   - VERIFICATION:
     - Rating form appears when expert has diagnosed an issue.
     - Farmers can submit new ratings and update existing ones.
     - Ratings are properly associated with expert, farmer, and crop issue.

[E10] Marketplace Product View Route Error
   - SYMPTOM: Clicking "View" button on marketplace products resulted in broken image paths or potential errors.
   - CAUSE:
     1. Incorrect static file path construction in `product_detail.html`: Used `filename=''` instead of `filename=product.product_image_path`.
     2. Missing null check for farmer object could cause template errors if farmer doesn't exist.
     3. Same incorrect path pattern in `my_products.html` thumbnail images.
   - FIX:
     1. **Fixed static file path** in `product_detail.html`: Changed from `url_for('static', filename=''){{ product.product_image_path }}` to `url_for('static', filename=product.product_image_path)`.
     2. **Added farmer validation** in `product_detail` route: Checks if farmer exists before rendering template, redirects to marketplace index with flash message if not found.
     3. **Fixed thumbnail path** in `my_products.html`: Applied same path correction for consistency.
   - VERIFICATION:
     - Product detail pages load correctly with proper image display.
     - No errors when viewing products from marketplace listing.
     - Graceful handling of missing farmer data.
   
[E11] Render Deployment Login Crash (Internal Server Error)
   - SYMPTOM: Admin and Expert logins failed on Render production (500 Internal Error) but worked partially on localhost.
   - CAUSE: 
     1. Dashboard statistics used `db.session.bind.dialect.name`, which is deprecated/unreliable in newer SQLAlchemy versions on production.
     2. `krishi_bhavan_officer` role length (21 chars) exceeded `VARCHAR(20)` column limit in database.
   - FIX:
     1. Updated dashboard routes (`admin.py`, `expert.py`) to use `db.engine.dialect.name` for correct dialect detection.
     2. Increased `role` column length to `VARCHAR(50)` in `app/models/user.py`.
     3. Added auto-migration in `app/__init__.py` to update the column length on application startup.
