FARMERS PORTAL - BUG FIX SUMMARY
================================
Date: December 9, 2025

ERRORS FIXED:
=============

1. DATABASE ERROR: sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file
   - Root Cause: The 'instance' directory did not exist
   - Solution: Created the missing 'instance' directory at: c:\Users\nahan\Desktop\FARMERS PORTAL\instance
   - Status: FIXED ✓

2. CIRCULAR IMPORT ISSUE: Slow import causing application hang
   - Root Cause: prediction.py was importing DISEASE_ACTIONS from train_disease_model.py, causing unnecessary module loading
   - Solution: 
     a) Created new file: app/ml/constants.py
     b) Moved DISEASE_ACTIONS dictionary from train_disease_model.py to constants.py
     c) Updated prediction.py import statement:
        OLD: from app.ml.train_disease_model import DISEASE_ACTIONS
        NEW: from app.ml.constants import DISEASE_ACTIONS
   - Status: FIXED ✓

FILES CREATED:
==============
- app/ml/constants.py (new file with DISEASE_ACTIONS dictionary)

FILES MODIFIED:
===============
- app/ml/prediction.py (updated import statement on line 8)

DIRECTORIES CREATED:
====================
- instance/ (required for SQLite database)
